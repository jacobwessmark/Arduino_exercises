### Secret Code Arduino Project

This Arduino project is designed to control a locked chest with a secret code. It uses an Arduino board, an OLED display, buttons, LEDs, a servo motor, and a buzzer. The project is capable of locking and unlocking a chest based on a secret code entered through button presses. When the correct code is entered, the chest opens, and a message is displayed on the OLED screen.

**Key Features:**

- The project uses a secret code to lock and unlock the chest. The code can be reprogrammed using a "Prog" button.
- **OLED Display:** An OLED screen provides visual feedback, displaying messages like "Opening chest" and "You found: [item]."
- **LED Indicators:** Green and red LEDs indicate the locked/unlocked status of the chest.
- **Servo Motor:** A servo motor controls the chest's lid, allowing it to open and close.
- **Button Inputs:** Four buttons are used for code entry, and one button is used to program the secret code.
- **Buzzer:** A buzzer produces sounds when buttons are pressed and when the chest is unlocked.

**How to Use:**

1. Set up the Arduino board with the required components.
2. Program the secret code using the "Prog" button.
3. Press the buttons in the correct order to unlock the chest.
4. When the code is entered correctly, the chest will open, and a message will be displayed on the OLED screen.

**Technology Used:**

- Arduino board
- OLED display (Adafruit SSD1306)
- Servo motor
- Buttons
- LEDs
- Buzzer

Unlock the secret chest and discover its contents!

### Random Item Generator Arduino Project

This Arduino project, the "Random Item Generator," is designed to simulate finding random items from a list when pressing a button. It uses an Arduino board, an LCD screen, a button, and a buzzer. When the button is pressed, the project selects a random item from a predefined list and displays it on the LCD screen.

**Key Features:**

- **Random Item Selection:** The project generates a random item from a list when the button is pressed.
- **LCD Display:** An LCD screen displays the item that has been randomly selected.
- **Button Input:** A button is used to trigger the random item generation process.
- **Buzzer:** A buzzer produces sounds when the button is pressed.

**How to Use:**

1. Set up the Arduino board with the required components.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. Press the button, and the project will display a randomly selected item from the list on the LCD screen.

**Technology Used:**

- Arduino board
- LCD screen (LiquidCrystal)
- Button
- Buzzer

Discover random items with the push of a button!
